 # Python MQTT Sender
This repository contains python file which sends data from Serial port to MQTT Broker present online.
I used Arduino Mega for getting values to the computer. The Mega sends 6 numbers (here) in a format. This is read and sent over the internet connection to the Cloud broker (in my case CloudMqtt.com).
